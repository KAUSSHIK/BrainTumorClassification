# Brain Tumor Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks

This repository contains code for a brain tumor classification project using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with TensorFlow and Keras. The project aims to classify brain tumors in MRI images into distinct categories.

## Project Overview

- **Objective:** To develop a CNN model capable of accurately categorizing brain tumors in MRI images.
- **Tools and Technologies:** TensorFlow, Keras, Python, IPython Widgets, OpenCV
- **Dataset:** The model was trained and tested on a dataset comprising over 3,000 MRI images.
  
## Key Features

- Implemented a CNN architecture using transfer learning with EfficientNet pre-trained on ImageNet.
- Achieved an impressive accuracy of 97% on the test set.
- Developed an interactive UI using IPython widgets for real-time image classification.
- Conducted thorough validation using real-world medical data, ensuring practical applicability.
